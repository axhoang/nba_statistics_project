# Redefining NBA Talent Metrics: A Data-Driven Approach

## Overview

The NBA landscape has been experiencing an analytic-driven revolution. To optimize talent scouting, understand the game's evolution, and adjust team strategies, we embarked on an extensive data analysis journey of NBA player metrics.

## PACE Strategy Document

### **P (Purpose)**

Redefine the understanding of player performance metrics to adapt to modern basketball's evolving dynamics.

### **A (Audience)**

- **Internal**: NBA Analytics Department, Talent Scouts, Team Managers, Coaches.
- **External**: Media, Fans, Analysts, Sponsors.

### **C (Critical Questions) & Insights**

1. **Distribution of Numerical Features**: What do player metrics' distributions reveal about NBA player performance norms?
    - **Findings**: Player metrics like 'Age', 'Games Played (GP)', 'Minutes Played (MP)', and 'Points (PTS)' showed distinct patterns. These provide insights into player stamina, importance to a team, offensive capabilities, and efficiency in various shot types.

2. **Analysis of Teams and Positions**: How are teams and positions distributed in the dataset?
    - **Findings**: Teams like SAC, WASH, POR, and SAS had more players, indicating more frequent roster changes or extensive data collection. Shooting Guards (SG) were predominant, suggesting a league trend favoring perimeter shooting.

3. **Correlation with Age**: How does a player's age correlate with performance metrics?
    - **Findings**: 2-point shooting percentage exhibited a strong positive correlation with age. Older players may be opting for closer-range shots.

4. **Statistical Testing Insights**: 
    - **Sampling & Central Limit Theorem**: The sample mean of points scored by players is close to the population mean, proving the Central Limit Theorem's application.
    - **Confidence Intervals**: The interval for minutes played by Shooting Guards in the NBA indicates that they play between 17.62 and 20.95 minutes on average (with 95% confidence). This can influence player rotation strategies.
    - **Hypothesis Testing**: There's no significant difference in the average minutes played by Point Guards and Shooting Guards. This insight can affect coaching decisions and player utilization.

### **E (Execution)**

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data quality and integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Uncover patterns, relationships, and insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Validate findings and dig deeper into specific hypotheses.
- **Visualization**: Offer compelling visual representations of insights.
- **Recommendation**: Provide actionable strategies based on the analysis.

## Detailed Analyses & Findings



## Recommendations & Future Steps

1. **Player Management**: Consider age when signing new players or renewing contracts.
2. **Tactical Decisions**: Emphasize perimeter defense and versatility, given the prominence of SGs.
3. **Player Development**: Focus on 2-point shooting efficiency training for younger players.
4. **Future Analysis**: Investigate why specific teams have more players in the dataset.
5. **Data Collection**: Ensure more standardized data collection methods for future datasets.
6. **Further Hypothesis Testing**: Explore metrics between drafted vs. undrafted players or experience's impact on performance.

## Conclusion

The modern NBA player's profile is continuously evolving. This dataset provides insights for tactical and strategic decisions in basketball. While our analysis offers a foundation, the world of sports analytics always has more to uncover!
