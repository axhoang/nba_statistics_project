# Redefining NBA Talent Metrics: A Data-Driven Approach

## Hypothetical Scenario

The NBA is witnessing a shift in player performance and the metrics that define a "star" player. Traditional metrics, such as points per game, are now often accompanied by advanced statistics to provide a more holistic view of a player's impact. The NBA's Analytics Department wants to better understand these metrics to redefine their talent scouting processes, optimize team compositions, and understand the evolution of the game.

## PACE Strategy Document

### **P (Purpose)**

Analyze the NBA player dataset to identify patterns in player performance metrics, understand the importance of various metrics in determining a player's value, and recognize trends over time.

### **A (Audience)**

- **Internal**: NBA Analytics Department, Talent Scouts, Team Managers, Coaches.
- **External**: Media, Fans, Analysts, Sponsors.

### **C (Critical Questions)**

1. What are the key metrics that define an elite NBA player in the current era?
2. How have player metrics evolved over the years?
3. Are there position-specific metrics that are more valuable than others (e.g., 3P% for guards vs. FG% for centers)?
4. How can we leverage these insights to optimize team compositions and strategies?
5. Are there any underrated metrics that could be indicative of future NBA stars?

### **E (Execution)**

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data quality and integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identify significant metrics and trends.
- **Visualization**: Create compelling visual representations of findings.
- **Reporting**: Summarize findings and provide actionable insights.
